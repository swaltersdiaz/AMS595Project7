# AMS 595 Project 7

This program demonstrates several basic C++ concepts, including conditional statements, vectors, loops, functions, recursion, and generating Pascal's Triangle. The file contains all the functions as well as a `main()` function that runs each part in order.

## What the Program Does

When you run the program, it will go through each section automatically:

### 1. Conditional Statement

The program first asks you to enter an integer. Using a `switch` statement, it prints whether the number is `-1`, `0`, `1`, or some other value.

### 2. Printing a Vector

Next, it prints the vector `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}` using a separate `print_vector` function.

### 3. Fibonacci Generator

The program prints Fibonacci numbers starting at 1 and continuing until the value exceeds 4,000,000.

### 4. Functions Section

This part includes three demonstrations:

* **isprime(n):** Checks whether a number is prime.
* **factorize(n):** Prints all positive factors of a number.
* **prime_factorize(n):** Prints the prime factorization of a number.

Test functions (`test_isprime`, `test_factorize`, and `test_prime_factorize`) run automatically and print sample outputs.

### 5. Pascal's Triangle

Finally, the program prints the first 5 rows of Pascal's Triangle using the `pascal(n)` function.

## Notes

* User input is only required once at the beginning for the conditional statement.
* All other output is printed automatically when the program runs.
